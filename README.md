Features of the SDLC Waterfall Model
Sequential Approach: The waterfall model involves a sequential approach to software development, where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next one.
Document-Driven: The waterfall model relies heavily on documentation to ensure that the project is well-defined and the project team is working towards a clear set of goals.
Quality Control: The waterfall model places a high emphasis on quality control and testing at each phase of the project, to ensure that the final product meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.
Rigorous Planning: The waterfall model involves a rigorous planning process, where the project scope, timelines, and deliverables are carefully defined and monitored throughout the project lifecycle.
Overall, the waterfall model is used in situations where there is a need for a highly structured and systematic approach to software development. It can be effective in ensuring that large, complex projects are completed on time and within budget, with a high level of quality and customer satisfaction.
